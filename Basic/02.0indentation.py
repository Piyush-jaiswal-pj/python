#Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")#this code gives error because of the space in print syntax
#at least one space needed
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")#his works perfectly

# = comments and for multi line comments as such it havent have any syntax
